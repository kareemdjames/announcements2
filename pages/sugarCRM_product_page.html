            <h1>Sugar CRM</h1>
            <br>
            <p> SugarCRM enables businesses to create extraordinary customer relationships with the most empowering, adaptable and affordable customer relationship management (CRM) solution on the market. We are the industry’s leading company focused exclusively on customer relationship management. Helping our clients build a unique customer experience through great customer relationships is our sole focus.<br>
            <br>
            Today, digital disruption is driving a tectonic shift in how companies deliver an extraordinary customer experience, inventing new ways to connect with and deliver value to customers. The companies that win in this era of empowered customers do so because they create better relationships with their customers. But you can’t deliver a superior customer experience with the same old CRM. You need a new kind of CRM.<br>
            <br>
            Sugar is the solution for CRM heroes, mavericks, innovative, forward-thinking change agents. The brave, the bold, who dare to be different. Our customers look for new solutions that will give them a competitive edge. They look at the default choice, and question whether it is the best choice. They see Sugar as the chance to find a better way to grow their business and help their employees do their jobs better. It’s the CRM that does more to adapt to your business -- the easiest CRM there is to customize, extend and deploy. And it’s the CRM that can enable everyone across your entire organization to become a customer expert and make a difference.<br>
            <br>
            Recognized by leading market analysts as a CRM visionary and innovator, Sugar is deployed by more than 2 million individuals in over 120 countries and 26 languages.
