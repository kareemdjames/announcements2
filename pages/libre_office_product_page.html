            <h1>Libre Office</h1>
            <br>
            <p> LibreOffice is a powerful office suite – its clean interface and feature-rich tools help you unleash your creativity and enhance your productivity. LibreOffice includes several applications that make it the most powerful Free and Open Source office suite on the market: Writer (word processing), Calc (spreadsheets), Impress (presentations), Draw (vector graphics and flowcharts), Base (databases), and Math (formula editing).<br>
            <br>
            Your documents will look professional and clean, regardless of their purpose: a letter, a master thesis, a brochure, financial reports, marketing presentations, technical drawings and diagrams. LibreOffice makes your work look great while you focus on the content.<br>
            <br>
            LibreOffice is compatible with a wide range of document formats such as Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. But LibreOffice goes much further with its native support for a modern and open standard, the OpenDocument Format (ODF). With LibreOffice, you have maximum control over your data and content – and you can export your work in many different formats including PDF.<br>
            <br>
            Beyond the many features shipped by default, LibreOffice is easily extensible through its powerful extensions mechanisms. Get even more features and document templates on our dedicated websites.<br>
            <br>
            LibreOffice is Free and Open Source Software, available for everyone to use, share and modify, and produced by a worldwide community of hundreds of developers. Our software is tested and used daily by a large and devoted user community – we're open to new talent and new ideas, so get involved and influence its future.<br>
            <br>
            LibreOffice is a successor to OpenOffice.org (commonly known as OpenOffice), which in turn was based on StarOffice. Many years of development have gone into the software, and it has been used in its various incarnations by millions. Today, LibreOffice is by far the most active continuation of the OpenOffice.org codebase, with releases every six months and hundreds of contributors. Also, LibreOffice uses libraries from the Document Liberation Project, handing control back to content creators.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <br>
            In LibreOffice 5.4, file format compatibility has been improved, with better support for EMF vector images. In addition, imported PDF files are rendered with much better quality, while a new colour palette has been added as well. On Linux, you can use OpenPGP keys for signing your ODF documents.<br>
            <br>
            In Writer, you can now import AutoText from Microsoft Word dotm templates. When you're exporting or pasting numbered and bulleted lists as plain text, their full structure is preserved. There's also a new watermark feature, accessible via the Format menu, while new context menu items have been added for working with sections, footnotes, endnotes and styles.<br>
            <br>
            Calc now includes support for pivot charts, which use data from pivot tables – and when the table is updated, the chart is automatically updated as well. Meanwhile, comments are now easier to manage, with menu commands to show, hide and delete all comments. When you're applying conditional formatting to cells, you can now easily change the priority of rules, with up and down buttons. Then there are extra sheet protection options, to allow insertion or deletion of rows and columns, and when you're exporting in CSV format, your settings are remembered for the next export operation.<br>
            <br>
            In Impress, when you're duplicating an object, you can now specify fractional angles. In addition, your settings are saved for the next duplication operation. Finally, a new keyboard shortcut was added, Ctrl+M, to insert a new slide.<br>
            <br>
            LibreOffice Online has been improved as well. Performance is better, while the layout adapts responsively to mobile devices. In addition, a read-only mode has been added, along with change tracking support, native comment rendering and editing, and initial support for Asian language input methods.<br>
