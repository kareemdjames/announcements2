            <h1>Open Shot</h1>
            <br>
            <p> OpenShot Video Editor is a free, open-source video editor for Linux, Mac, and Windows. We designed OpenShot to be an easy to use, quick to learn, and surprisingly powerful video editor. Easily cut, slice, and edit any video or film.<br>
            <br>
            OpenShot was created in August 2008, by Jonathan Thomas, a software developer from North Texas (USA). However, Jonathan is now assisted by many key developers: Meet the Developers. In 2012, OpenShot Studios, LLC was incorporated by Jonathan Thomas, and all copyright and trademark properties were transferred to this new company, to better protect the interests of each contributor. Soon after, OpenShot Studios joined the Open Invention Network (OIN), in order to strengthen it's ability to protect the contributors and source-code.<br>
            <br>
            OpenShot Video Editorâ„¢ is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br>
            <br>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <br>
            OpenShot supports the following operating systems: Linux (most distributions are supported), Windows (version 7, 8, and 10+), and OS X (version 10.9+). Project files are also cross-platform, meaning you can save a video project in one OS, and open it on another. All OpenShot features are available on all platforms.<br>
            <br>
            Based on the powerful FFmpeg library, OpenShot can read and write most video and image formats. For a full list of supported formats, see the FFmpeg project. OpenShot's export dialog defaults to some of the more common formats, but with the advanced tab, you can use any FFmpeg format.<br>
            <br>
            OpenShot comes with a powerful key frame animation framework, capable of an unlimited number of key frames and animation possibilities. Key frames interpolation mode can be quadratic bezier curves, linear, or constant, which determines how the animated values are calculated.<br>
            <br>
            Integration with the user's desktop is a key feature of OpenShot. Native file browsers, window borders, and full drag and drop support with the native file system. Getting started is as easy as dragging files into OpenShot from your favorite file manager.<br>
            <br>
            Tracks are used to layer images, videos, and audio in a project. You can create as many layers as needed, such as watermarks, background audio tracks, background videos, etc... Any transparency will show through the layer below it. Tracks can also be moved up, down, or locked.<br>
            <br>
            Clips on the timeline can be adjusted in many ways, including scaling, trimming, rotation, alpha, snapping, and adjusting X,Y location. These properties can also be animated over time with just a few clicks! You can also use our transform tool to interactively resize clips.<br>
            <br>
            Over 400 transitions are included in OpenShot, which lets you gradually fade from one clip to another. The quickness and sharpness of the transitions can also be adjusted using keyframes (if needed). Overlapping two clips will create a new transition automatically.<br>
            <br>
            When arranging clips in a video project, images on the higher tracks/layers will be displayed on top, and the lower tracks will be displayed behind them. Much like a stack of paper, items on top cover up items below them. And if you cut any holes out (i.e. transparency) the lower images will show though.<br>
            <br>
            Over 40 vector title templates are included with OpenShot, which makes adding titles to your project fun and easy. You can also create your own SVG vector titles, and use those as templates instead. Quickly adjust the font, color, and text of your titles in our built-in title editor.<br>
            <br>
            Render amazing 3D animations inside OpenShot, powered by the wonderful, open-source Blender application. OpenShot comes with more than 20 animations, and lets you adjust colors, sizes, length, text, and many render properties (such as reflectivity, bevel, extrude, and more).<br>
            <br>
            Our advanced video editing timeline has a ton of great features for helping you build a great video project. Dragging and dropping, resizing clips, zooming in and out, alignment, preset animations and settings, slicing, snapping, and more! Just drag a file onto the timeline to begin!<br>
            <br>
            Our video editing library (libopenshot) has been built with accuracy in mind. This allows OpenShot to finely adjust which frames are shown (and when). Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to step frame by frame through your video project.<br>
            <br>
            Control the power of time with OpenShot! Speed up and slow down clips. Reverse the direction of a video. Or manually animate the speed and direction of your clip as you wish, using our powerful key frame animation system.<br>
            <br>
            OpenShot has many great audio editing features built-in, such as displaying waveforms on the timeline, or even rendering the waveform as part of your video. You can also split the audio from your video clip, and adjust each audio channel individually.<br>
            <br>
            OpenShot includes many video effects (with more on the way). Drag a video effect onto your clip, and adjust it's properties (many which can be animated). Adjust brightness, gamma, hue, greyscale, chroma key, and much more! Combined with transitions, animation, and time control, OpenShot is an extremely powerful video editor.
